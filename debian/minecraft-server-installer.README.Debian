minecraft-server-installer for Debian
------------------------------

This package installs the Minecraft server by downloading it from the official
Minecraft website. This package does *not* contain the Minecraft server itself
as that would breach copyright laws and the wishes of Markus Persson, the author
of Minecraft.
